                Collaboration between universities and industries is critical important for skills development
                through education and training and adoption of knowledge through innovation and technology
                transferring. In producing an internationally accredited Technologist in the field of Information
                and Communication Technology, the Department of ICT has recently formed an Industrial Consultative
                Committee (ICC) in order to provide students with the necessary technical and professional skills
                to face the challenges and adapt better for the rapidly changing phases of the highly competitive
                job market in today's world. In the accomplishment of this mission, the role of ICC is of immense
                importance as it plays a vital role in ensuring that our degree program, curriculum and academic
                activities stay aligned with the desired capacity and industrial requirements leading to the production
                of a high-quality professional graduates.Academics and students of the Department wish to maintain a
                wide range of industrial collaboration portfolios like consultancy appointments, student participation
                in industrial collaboration projects, internships and visiting lectures etc.

            <P>
                The COVID 19 pandemic has created a real predicament, where the entire human population facing one of the
                deadliest challenges the world has ever encountered. Individuals and organizations are running after solutions for the problems
                it has created, paving the way for many innovations and inventions around the world. In times like these, Sri Lankan
                universities too have stepped up to the plate in various capacities to ensure the fight against this virus isn't fought
                alone. Whilst the government of Sri Lanka has delayed and re-scheduled the initially planned election to protect voters,
                a group of students from the Department of Engineering Technology, Faculty of Technology, University of Ruhuna have developed
                an 'Automated Small Finger Marker' to aid officials to mark voters in an election. This machine has the capability to mark
                the small finger of a voter automatically and display the total number of voters on an LCD screen. Also, it is automatically
                sanitized after one use and the next voter and use it safely without the fear of contamination.

            <img src="./assets/uni/covid19-comp.png" alt="" height="200px">
            <P>
                A group of undergraduates of the Faculty of Technology, University of Ruhuna, has won third place in Versus COVID Competition
                organised by the IEEE Student Branch of the University of Peradeniya. They have won this place for their project proposal
                for making a Modified Hazmat Suit with Controllable Inside Temperature. M. H. D. D. Jinasena, M. L. P. W. Dias, and
                H. W. S. Dhanujika are the members of the winning team. A hazmat suit is the main personal protective equipment worn by
                all healthcare professionals including physicians, nurses, and attendants who treat COVID 19 patients. Since no specific
                treatment is available up to date for preventing COVID 19 infection, healthcare measures play a vital role in minimising
                its spread. However, the hazmat suit currently worn by healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka is not very comfortable.
                Wearing it all the daylong may lead to complete exhaustion seriously affecting the efficiency and quality of their job
                performance.The Modified Hazmat Suit proposed by Ruhuna undergraduates has been designed to cater to this need.
